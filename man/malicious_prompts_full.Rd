\description{
The complete dataset of 373,646 labeled text prompts from the HuggingFace
malicious-prompts dataset (ahsanayub/malicious-prompts). This comprehensive
dataset contains examples of potentially harmful text inputs designed to bypass
safety mechanisms in language models, along with benign prompts from various sources.
}
\details{
Label distribution:
\itemize{
  \item Benign (0): 285,950 prompts (76.5%)
  \item Malicious (1): 87,696 prompts (23.5%)
}

This dataset is significantly larger than \code{malicious_prompts_sample} and is
recommended for training production-ready models. Due to its size (453 MB uncompressed),
loading may take a few seconds.
